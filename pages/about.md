## About the collection

This is a collection of images of statewide ballot proposals scanned to PDF format. 
This may not be a complete collection. It consists of images of paper documents obtained by the Library of Michigan, State Law Library.
Because searching the full text of these documents can result in many false hits for researchers who already know the year of the ballot proposal they are
looking for, this static website only indexes the election years of the ballot proposals. This allows library staff who are helping researchers to quickly zero-in
on specific requested documents without having to sift through full-text results.
