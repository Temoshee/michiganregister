# About the collection

+ This is a collection of issues of the monthly publication *Michigan Register*.
+ It consists of images of paper documents which were not "born digital."
+ Because searching the full text of these documents can result in many false hits for researchers who already know the year of the volume they are looking for, this static index only lists the dates of issues, not what is inside those issues.
+ This site was created for library staff who are helping researchers to quickly zero-in on specifically requested documents without having to sort through full-text results.
+ Please <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/libraryofmichigan/0,9327,7-381-88848-123290--,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> with any questions or concerns. We are happy to help!
