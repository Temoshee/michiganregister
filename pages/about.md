# About the collection

+ This is a collection of images of statewide ballot proposals scanned to PDF format. 
+ This may not be a complete collection. It consists of images of paper documents obtained by the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/lawlibrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Library of Michigan, State Law Library</a>
+ Because searching the full text of these documents can result in many false hits for researchers who already know the year of the ballot proposal they are looking for, this static index only lists the election years of the ballot proposals. 
+ This allows library staff who are helping researchers to quickly zero-in on specifically requested documents without having to sift through full-text results.
+ If you do not know the year of a ballot proposal, one place to start is with <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Initia_Ref_Under_Consti_12-08_339399_7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Bureau of Elections online document (which also shows results).</a>
+ Please <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/libraryofmichigan/0,9327,7-381-88848-123290--,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> with any questions or concerns. We are happy to help!
